# Sector Momentum Rotation (US) — Base vs Risk-Managed Overlay (2001–2026)
# What this project is

In summary, it is a reproducible backtest of a monthly US sector rotation strategy that uses sector ETFs, benchmarked against SPY (S&P 500 ETF). The project includes:

- "base" strategy: fully invested sector momentum rotation (top sectors by 12–1, momentum rebalanced monthly, costs included)

- Risk-managed overlay: the same base strategy but with macro regime + volatility targeting that can reduce exposure (held cash) in stressed regimes

Sample: monthly data from 2001-02 to 2026-01 (300 month end observations; 299 monthly returns).

# How it works:

1) Signal: 12–1 momentum (skips most recent month (in order to avoid short-term reversal))

Each month:

It computes each sector’s return over the past 12 months excluding the most recent month

it then ranks sectors by that momentum score

2) Portfolio construction (Base strategy)

hold Top 3 sectors

equal-weight

rebalance monthly

3) Trading frictions

transaction costs modeled as turnover × 10 bps

base series is reported as net of modeled costs

4) Risk-managed overlay (Macro + Vol Targeting) (refered to (here) as maro overlay strategy as well)

In addition to the base strategy:

apply a lagged volatility target (rolling realized vol, scale applied with a one month lag)

use a 2-state macro regime (risk on/risk off) to set different vol targets:

Risk-on target ≈ 15%

Risk-off target ≈ 10%

when scale < 1, the remainder is held as cash (cash return assumed ~0%)

Key results (Full period: 2001-02 → 2026-01)

Growth of $1 (rebased to start):

Base: 8.31×

Macro overlay: 6.95×

SPY: 7.93×

Risk & return summary (annualized, rf=0 Sharpe):

Series	      Ann Return	Ann Vol	 Sharpe	 Max Drawdown
Base	        8.96%	      14.48%	 0.619	  -39.06%
Macro overlay	8.14%	      12.92%	 0.630	  -33.43%
SPY	          9.11%	      14.92%	 0.610	  -50.78%

Interpretation:

Base is the growth-maximizing strategy in this sample (nearly matches SPY return, smaller drawdown).

Macro overlay is the risk-managed version: lower volatility and a meaningfully smaller max drawdown, at the cost of some CAGR.

Regime breakdown (tables generated by the notebook)
Lost decade proxy (2001–2010)

Base: 5.02% ann return, -39.06% max DD

Macro overlay: 4.85% ann return, -33.43% max DD

SPY: 2.04% ann return, -50.78% max DD

Post-GFC bull (2011–2026)

Base: 11.42% ann return, -19.94% max DD

Macro overlay: 10.23% ann return, -19.01% max DD

SPY: 13.88% ann return, -23.93% max DD

Overlay exposure behavior (what the “risk overlay” actually does)

From the exported vol_target_scale.csv / cash_weight.csv:

Average exposure (scale): 0.894 (≈ 89.4% invested on average)

Average cash weight: 10.6%

Minimum scale: 0.446 (max cash ≈ 55.4%)

Months with scale < 1: 43%

Months with scale < 0.8: 26%

This makes the overlay a risk-budget wrapper: it does not add leverage (cap=1.0), it only reduces exposure in higher-risk periods.
